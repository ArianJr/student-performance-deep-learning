## üß™ Model Evaluation

Performance is evaluated using metrics including:

| Metric          | Description                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy        | Proportion of correctly predicted outcomes          |
| Precision       | Correct positive predictions / Total positive predictions |
| Recall          | Correct positive predictions / Actual positives    |
| F1-Score        | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall               |
| Mean Squared Error | Measures prediction error for regression tasks   |

*Include specific results from your trained models for completeness.*
